# Grouper Application

Grouper Application is a list based application meant to take advantage of the latest APIs from Google in order to randomize groups.

#What does it do? 

Grouper takes any number of groups, and outputs them in a list of subgroups, of a size specified by the user. 

# Status: BETA

It's important to note that this doesn't completely work yet. The second list does not appear. In addition, it is impossible to delete entries when added, making removal of entries possible only by clearing data in the app. 

The first issue will be trivial to fix, and the second requires a bit of research with ViewPager. More features to be added in the future as well once I get a free couple of minutes.
